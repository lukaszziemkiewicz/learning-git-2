		<h1>Right Here Waiting for You</h1>
		<p>Richard Marx</p>
		
		<p class="text">
			Oceans apart day after day 
			And I slowly go insane 
			I hear your voice on the line
			But it doesn't stop the pain
			If I see you next to never
			How can we say forever

			Wherever you go
			Whatever you do
			I will be right here waiting for you
			Whatever it takes
			Or how my heart breaks
			I will be right here waiting for you

			I took for granted, all the times
			That I thought would last somehow
			I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
			But I can't get near you now
			Oh, can't you see it baby
			You've got me going crazy

			Wherever you go
			Whatever you do
			I will be right here waiting for you
			Whatever it takes
			Or how my heart breaks
			I will be right here waiting for you
			I wonder how we can...
